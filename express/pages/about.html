      <p> My name is Peter and this website is intedended to showcase my passions
        which are programming and photography.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I started to take photos when I was in high school. I took a photography class that taught me how the basics of photography.
        It also taught me how to develop and print film photos, which were the kind of photos we mainly took.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Another inspiration for my love of photography was my best friend who was also really into photography. The reason I started to take more photos this is was because he gave me his
        old film camera. That's the camera I use to take the photos you see on this website.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My background for computer programming comes from my major as a computer science major. I graduated with a CS degree from San Francisco State University.
        This website is one of my personal project that I've been working on.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is my <a href = "https://github.com/peterlinlin">github</a> of other projects I have done.
